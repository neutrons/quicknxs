    Notes:

    - Version is preferred in the following order, from most to least preferred: ['4.2.0', '4.1.0', '4.0.0']
    - Preferred installation location is under /opt, e.g. "/opt/mantid42". If no preferred installation is found,
      then a mantid installation is searched in the locations specified by `sys.path`.
    - NOTE: the preferred installation is not tested for integrity. Only the existence of the location is tested,
      but not its contents.
