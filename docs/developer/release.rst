Candidate and Production Releases
---------------------------------
- Follow the `Software Maturity Model <https://ornl-neutrons.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NDPD/pages/23363585/Software+Maturity+Model>`_
  for continuous versioning, as well as creating Candidate and Production releases.\
- Right before a Major or Minor release, update the release notes file ``docs/releasenotes/index.rst```.
  then create a new Candidate release just to include these changes in the release.


Conda Package
-------------

Candidate and Production releases ``reflectivity_ui`` are automatically released to the project channel
`neutrons`_ whenever a new tag is pushed to the repository.

To manually build a conda package (for testing puruposes only),
replicate locally the steps taken by the GitHub Actions job "Build Conda package" in the workflow file
``.github/workflows/actions.yml``.
