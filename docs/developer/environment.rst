Setup Local Development Environment
-----------------------------------

To setup a local development environment, the developers should follow the steps below:

* Install ``anaconda`` (``miniconda`` is recommended)
* Clone the repository and make a feature branch based off ``next``.
* Create a new virtual environment with ``conda env create`` which uses ``environment.yml``

.. code-block:: sh

   conda env create --file environment.yml

* Activate the virtual environment with ``conda activate quicknxs``
* Activate the pre-commit hooks

.. code-block:: sh

   pre-commit install


The ``environment.yml`` contains all of the dependencies for both the developer and the build servers.
Update file ``environment.yml`` if dependencies are added to the package.


Test Data
---------

The test data will be stored in a second git repository
`reflectivity_ui-data <https://code.ornl.gov/sns-hfir-scse/infrastructure/test-datareflectivity_ui-data>`_
which uses git-lfs.
To use it, first install git-lfs, then setup the git-submodule

.. code-block:: sh

   git submodule init
   git submodule update
